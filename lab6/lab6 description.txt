  The purpose of this lab is to introduce you to the building blocks of writing auditing rules deployed in
  Linux operating systems as well as Snort rules.
  General Information and Policies
  - Solutions must to be submitted on through the Moodle system.
  - Ideal reports include screen snapshots of all of the exercises as well as copies of data segments where
    applicable.
  Objectives
       -   To identify keywords of the rules syntax.
       -   To sample the auditing process of Linux environment.
Keywords
Snort, ipvar, portvar, alert, payload, log, pass, activate, dynamic, drop, reject, sdrop

Part 1: Introduction to Linux Operating Systems Auditing
    1. Download Linux Centos Operating System
           o https://www.centos.org/download/
                   ▪ http://centos.mirror.rafal.ca/7.6.1810/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-
                      x86_64-DVD-1810.iso
    2. Create a virtual machine on VirtualBox and link the image to the virtual machine
           o In VirtualBox ➔ Settings ➔ Optical Drive ➔ Select the image of Centos
    3. Fulfill the process of Centos Linux and keep all installation attributes (including
       specifying root password and creating a user) as per the default values.
    4. Start the audit demon service:
       systemctl start auditd.service
    5. Inspect the audit configuration file:
       cat /etc/audit/auditd.conf
       cat /etc/audit/auditd.conf|more
    6. Inspect the audit.log file
       cat /var/log/audit/audit.log
    7. Examine the auditctl command switches:
       auditctl|more
    8. List the auditing rules:
       auditctl -l

   9. Append a rule to the auditing rules list that log the access to the passwd file for
       events with write or change attribute:
       auditctl -a exit,always -F path=/etc/passwd -F perm=wa
   10. Attempt running the command
       auditctl -a exit,always -F path=/etc/passwd -F perm=wa
   11. List logs associated with the passwd file:
       ausearch -f /etc/passwd           <== where there any entries?
   12. Create a new user:
       adduser xyz
   13. List logs associated with the passwd file:
       ausearch -f /etc/passwd           <== where there any entries that maps to
                                                     the adduser command?
   14. In the output of running the command ausearch -f /etc/passwd, identify the
       system calls; system call type is identified by a number; run the following
       command to identify the type of each system calls were executed in association
       with adduser command:
       auscall x86_64 x         <=== where x is the system call number, such as:
                                            auscall x86_64 2

   15. Determine the file access permissions for the file /etc/passwd
       dir /etc/passwd -l
   16. Modify the permission to 640 for passwd
       Use the chmod command
   17. determine the current permissions for /etc/passwd:
       dir /etc/passwd -l
   18. Examine whether there is a new log entery for the /etc/passwd file:
       ausearch -f /etc/passwd
   19. Identify the value of the field COMM in the log.
   20. Create an audit report report for log entries associated with the passwd file:
       ausearch -f /etc/passwd | aureport -f -i
   21. Retrieve the login records of today:
       ausearch -m LOGIN --start today -i

  1. Direction of Traffic (<-->, ->, <-)
      1. The ______________ symbol is used to indicate traffic from internal network
         to external network.
      2. The ______________ symbol is used to indicate bidirectional traffic between
         internal and external networks.
      3. The ______________ symbol is used to indicate traffic from external to
         internal networks.
   2. Setup of Network Addresses (HOME_NET, EXTERNAL_NET, and ipvar)
   1. Declare all hosts in the internal network:
      Ipvar ____________________
   2. Declare all hosts in the external network
      Ipvar ____________________
   3. Declare the variable net100 for the 192.168.1.0, class C subnet and the and the
      10.1.1.0, class A subnet
      Ipvar _______ [192.168.1.0/24, ____________ ]
   4. Declare clientA as IP list that has two IPs:192.168.0.1 and 10.0.1.1
      Ipvar _________ [                    ,              ]
   3. Declare internal servers

      portvar _______________ [ 0 : ______ ]
   5. Simple Rules (Notice that content rules are case sensitive unless you use the "nocase" option)
   1. Write a rule that alerts for any tcp traffic from any external network to any internal
      network (use action as alert, source IP as any, source port number as any,
      destination IP as any, destination port as HTTP port number, and the payload is
      has a HEAD, PUT, POST, or Delete but not !GET
      alert _______ ______ ______ -> ________ 80 (content: !”GET”;)
   2. Write a rule that alerts with the message “Backdoor signature was detected –
      Subseven Trojan”, where traffic is directed from the external network to the
      external network, the signature value/payload is "|0d0a5b52504c5d3030320d0a|",
      and the reference number for the vulnerability is arachnids,485
         o Use the syntax:
                 ▪   alert <protocol> <net> <port> -> <net> <port> (msg: “ ”;content: “ ”; reference:)
   3. Use the “bidirectional operator” and the “log” action command to record both
      sides of telnet sessions directed to from any network and port (except to from
      192.168.0.1/24) to 192.168.1.0/24 subnet at port 23
      ____________. !192.168.1.0/24 <> ___________/_____ ___________
