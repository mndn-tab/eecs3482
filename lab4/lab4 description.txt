SELinux implements four forms of access control policies:
•

Type Enforcement (TE): Type Enforcement is the primary mechanism of access
control used in the targeted policy.

•

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Based around SELinux users (not necessarily
the same as the Linux user), but not used in the default configuration of the
targeted policy.

•

Multi-Level Security (MLS): Not commonly used and often hidden in the default
targeted policy.

•

Multi-Category Security(MCS): An extension of Multi-Level Security, used in the
targeted policy to implement compartmentalization of virtual machines and
containers

The purpose of this lab is to introduce the four mechanisms as well as expose to the SELinux operating
systems labels.

General Information and Policies
- Solutions must to be submitted on through the Moodle system.
- Ideal reports include screen snapshots of all of the exercises as well as copies of data segments where
applicable.

Objectives
-

To introduce SELinux operating system.
To expose you to secure computational environments of cloud computing.

Keywords
SELinux, labeles. Selilinux-manage, mls, mcs, rbac, te.

Part 1: Activation of SELinux on Kali Linux
1. Using the VirtualBox create a new Kali Linux virtual machine
o Download the image at: https://images.offensive-security.com/virtualimages/kali-linux-2019.1-vbox-amd64.ova located at:
https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualboximage-download/
o Import the image to the VirtualBox Player: File ➔ Import Appliance

Next ➔ import
• If you encounter an error you might want to disable the
USB I/F

2. Log in to the server using the credentials root, toor (username, password).
3. The next step is to configure SELinux (activate and enable the security policy):
3.1 Start a terminal session
3.2 Get the default policy and the basic set of SELinux utilities by running
apt-get install selinux-basics selinux-policy-default auditd

3.3 Run selinux-activate to configure GRUB and PAM and to create
/.autorelabel
4. Reboot by typing reboot, it will take a while to label the filesystems on boot and
then it will automatically reboot a second time when that is complete.
4.1 Run check-selinux-installation to check that everything has been setup
correctly, there might be 2 or 3 false positives that you should ignore.
4.2 Test the current SELinux status by running sestatus (document the current
status).
4.3 Determine the current position of the directory by running: pwd
4.4 Verify and switch to the root directory by running: cd /root as well as: pwd
4.5 List the contents of the current directory by running ls -l
4.6 List the contents of the current directory by running (capital Z) to list contents in
SELnux format ls -Z
5. Type the contents of the file config using the command: cat /etc/selinux/config
5.1
What is the current status of SELINUX?
5.2
What is the current type of SELINUX?
6. Type the list of switches for the command semange ➔ semanage -h
7. Type the list of switches for the command semanage with Boolean option ➔
samanage Boolean
8. List all Boolean values ➔ semanage boolean -l
8.1
What is the default value of the fenced_can_ssh process?
8.2
What is the current value of the user_ping process?
8.3
Attempt: getsebool user_ping and getsebool fenced_can_ssh
9. Determine the current Boolean value for Apache capability to connect to
database:
getsebool httpd_can_network_connect_db

10. Modify the capability to allow Apache to connect to database
setsebool httpd_can_network_connect_db on
11. Verify whether the capability has been modified or not.
12. Make the change persistent across reboots using the command
setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect_db on

13. Determine the current context of the Apache server, what type of process is it?
ps axZ | grep httpd

14. List the currently supported roles in the environment ➔ seinfo -r
o If the policy analysis command tools are not installed, you will be
prompted to install them and agree to the process of installation.
15. Start the Apache Server: apache2ctl start
16. Verify the Status of the server: systemctl status apache2
17. Verify the current context by running step 13 above:
ps axZ | grep httpd

Part 2: Relabeling Files in SELinux
Using Apache as an example, suppose you want to change the DocumentRoot to serve web pages from
a location other than the default /var/www/html/ directory. Assume we create a directory at /html/ and
create an index.html file there:
1. Create Directory
mkdir /html
2. Create the index.html file
touch /html/index.html
3. List the context labels for the file
ls -Z /html/index.html
4. List the context label for the directory
ls -Z | grep html
5. Attempt to start the browser and document the output
6. Change the context for the directory
chcon -v --type=httpd_sys_content_t /html
7. Change the context for the file
chcon -v --type=httpd_sys_content_t /html/index.html
a. ls -Z /html/index.html
b. ls -Z | grep html
Document the output
8. Relabeling the entire file system
a. touch /.autorelabe

b. reboot
c. genhomedircon
d. touch /.autorelabel
e. reboot
document the output
9. Allowing access to ports and list the ports
a. semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 81
b. semanage port -l
