The purpose of this lab is to introduce to strategies and tools that are utilized in discovering
servers and networks. The lab also demonstrates several application layer protocol
interactions. sample application layer services. Using packet capturing software, you will be
demonstrating the basic concepts of the OSI, Specifically HTTP, FTP, SSL, Telnet, and SSH
protocols are demonstrated based on the stack.

General Information and Policies
- Solutions must to be submitted on through the blackboard system.
- Ideal reports include screen snapshots of all of the exercises.

Objectives
-

Map the theoretical context of the material learned in class to their implementation in
the real world.
Dissect popular network services using protocols analysis software.
Differentiate between network services based on the TCP/IP Reference Model.
Demonstrate secure application layer protocols.
Observe differences between Telnet and SSH.
Discover server type, name and IPs
Observe HTTP headers and HTTP error codes.

Keywords
IP, , promiscuous mode, HTTP, FTP, SSH, Telnet, http 200, http 301, http
302, IPv4, IPv6
